Question 1

You're having coffee/tea/beverage of your choice with a friend that is learning to program in Python. They're curious about why they would use pip. Explain what pip is and one benefit of using pip.

Answer:
Pip is a package manager for Python that enables the installation of specific modules which contain code libraries. Code libraries contain pre-written functions for specific purposes.
One benefit of using pip is that it makes packages easier to install. It prevents the user from having to install relevant compilers and dependencies manually
